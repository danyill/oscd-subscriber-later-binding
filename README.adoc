== What is this?

This plugin is intended to allow a user to carry out later-binding subscriptions for IEC 61850 GOOSE and SMV.

* This is a plugin for {uri-openscd-core}[open-scd-core], the core
editor engine for {uri-openscd}[OpenSCD].

* This plugin is a web component and follows the
{uri-openwc}[open-wc] recommendations.

* This plugin uses the link:LICENSE[Apache License] and is intended for you to use, study, share and improve.

It offers a publisher and subscriber view to allow efficient and intuitive use.
