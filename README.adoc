== What is this?

This plugin is intended to allow a user to carry out later-binding subscriptions for IEC 61850 GOOSE and SMV.

This is a plugin for OpenSCD core, the core editor engine for OpenSCD.



It offers a publisher and subscriber view to allow efficient and intuitive use.

Feel free to log issues to request fixes, improvements or new features.
