= Overview
include::partial$base.adoc[]

The plugin consists of view with two columns:

.Publisher View
[width=35%]
|===
|Published Data (FCDAs) |Available Subscribers (ExtRefs)
|===

.Subscriber View
[width=35%]
|===
|Available Subscribers (ExtRefs)|Published Data (FCDAs)
|===

At the top of each column there are a number of filter, sorting  or setting options image:sort_filter_settings.png[width=100].
These are explained in more detail in xref:publisher_view.adoc[] and xref:subscriber_view.adoc[].

The choice of which view to use depend on user preferences and the task undertaken.
The publisher view allows the user to conceptualise the task based on the information sent from a particular device (and able to be configured from one device to multiple devices) whereas the subscriber view focuses on the received devices.

== Searching

This plugin features powerful search.
If it is displayed on the screen it should be searchable.
Search is case-sensitive and multiple terms can be used.

To search, enter text in the search field.
Common searches include: IED name, control block name, the `desc` field on an `LDevice`, `LNode`, Data Object or `ExtRef`.

You can also:

* search on a common data class, e.g. `ACT` or `SPS`
* search on a basic type, e.g. `Quality` or `Dbpos`
* search across spaces, e.g. `"XCBR 4"` or `'XCBR 4'`
* search with wildcards, e.g. `VB01?` or `Bay*Close`

NOTE: We are interested in  what additional search capability users would like, please {url-issues}[log an issue] or {url-chat}[visit the chat].

== Data type information

By hovering over a published item, the common data class and the basic type are displayed.

TIP: These are not able to be shown for external references unless preferred attributes are configured.
