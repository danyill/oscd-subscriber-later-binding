// TIP:
// the above URI is done by taking the plugins object from demo.html and updating to
// the correct {uri-ci-bundle} value and then in the browser calling:
//
//   console.log(`https://openscd.github.io/open-scd/?plugins=${encodeURI(JSON.stringify(plugins))}`)
//
// Don't forget the last bracket in the attribute definition.


// == Online Using the Latest open-scd-core
//
// === Using a URL
//
// Open SCD core allows plugins to be loaded from a URL.
//
// You can click on {uri-openscd-core-plugin}[this link] to trial this plugin.
//
// In this view it is without theming and only presents this plugin along with the open and save plugins.
//
// === Manually
//
// . The latest core is available at {uri-openscd-core-app}.
//
// . Go to menu:Menu[Add plugins...]
//
// . Select Cancel - this is an editor plugin.
//
// . Select OK to required a loaded document.
//
// . Choose a plugin name of '{plugin-title}'.
//
// . Choose a plugin icon of 'link'
//
// . Provide a plugin source URI of: {uri-ci-bundle}
//
// . Click OK on the summary, it should like similar to that shown below:

//
// . Open a file and enjoy!

== Locally for testing

See xref:development.adoc[].

== Online using the latest development version

{uri-openscd-core-plugin-demo}[Try it out online]!

This demo also includes some add-on plugins to provide specific functionality for {uri-addon-plugin-siemens}[Siemens], {uri-addon-plugin-sel}[SEL] and {uri-addon-plugin-nr}[NR Electric] IEDs. To use this, enable it first by opening the menu plugin and checking "Enable".

== As part of the community OpenSCD distribution

NOTE: OpenSCD is transitioning to use of `open-scd-core`, these instructions will require updating at the end of this transition.

. Open your OpenSCD distribution or use {uri-openscd-app}.

. Create a custom extension by going to menu:menu[Extensions>Add Custom Extension].

. Enter the name '{plugin-title}', select 'Editor tab' and enter {uri-ci-bundle} as the URL.
+
This is the URL of the bundle built by CI and is always the latest alpha version of this plugin.
+
.OpenSCD Add Custom Extension Screen
image::screenshot-add-extension.png[width=300]

. Click on menu:Add[].

. Until OpenSCD is fully transitioned to open-scd-core, a conversion plugin is also required to interface between the old and new APIs.

. Create another custom extension by going to menu:menu[Extensions>Add Custom Extension].

. Enter the name 'Action Translate', select 'Menu entry' and enter {uri-action-translate-ci-bundle} as the URL.
+
This is the URL of the bundle built by CI and is always the latest alpha version of this plugin.

. You should now be able to scroll across in the menu-bar and find a tab, "{plugin-title}"
+
TIP: If there are too many editor plugin, hold down shift and wheel-mouse up and down to scroll them easily.

== As part of your own distribution

=== Within the current OpenSCD distribution

. Within the current OpenSCD distribution, plugins are stored in the `public/js/plugins.js` folder.
Each plugin appears in the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
    name: '{plugin-title}', // <.>
    src: '{uri-ci-bundle}', //  <.>
    icon: 'link', // <.>
    default: true, // <.>
    kind: 'editor', // <.>
    requireDoc: true, // <.>
    position: 'middle' // <.>
  }
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource.
For a local resource, begins without a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/{plugin-name}/dist/{plugin-name}.js`.
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the build process.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> The type of plugin, either `menu` or `editor`. This is an `editor` plugin.
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> A string, either `top`, `middle` or `bottom` to give a location in the menu.
Otherwise, it is inferred from the order in the file relative to other plugins.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.

=== Within an OpenSCD core distribution

Within an OpenSCD core distribution, plugins are also loaded from a json file with a slightly different schema.

. Typically, the distribution will be served from a static web page and within the web page there will be a plugins property declared on an `open-scd` object, for instance:
+
[source,js,subs="+attributes"]
----
<open-scd
  plugins='{
  "menu":
  [
    {"name": "Open File", "translations": {"de": "Datei öffnen"}, "icon": "folder_open", "active": true, "src": "https://openscd.github.io/oscd-open/oscd-open.js"},
    {"name": "Save File", "translations": {"de": "Datei speichern"}, "icon": "save", "active": true, "src": "https://openscd.github.io/oscd-save/oscd-save.js"}
  ],
  "editor":
  [
    {"name": "{plugin-title}", "translations": {"de": "Späte Bindung des Abonnenten", "pt": "Associação Tardia de Assinante"}, "icon": "link", "active": true, "requireDoc": true, "src": "/plugins/{plugin-name}/dist/{plugin-name}.js"}
  ]
}'
></open-scd>
----

. This plugin is an editor plugin, editor plugins are an array of JSON of the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
  "name": "{plugin-title}", // <.>
  "icon": "link", // <.>
  "active": true, // <.>
  "requireDoc": true, // <.>
  "src": "{uri-ci-bundle}" // <.>
}
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> Translations of the plugin name as required using standard locale names.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource.
For a local resource, begins without a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/{plugin-name}/dist/{plugin-name}.js`.
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the internet using the continuous integration build process.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.
