include::partial$base.adoc[]

This plugin features powerful search.
If it is displayed on the screen it should be searchable.
Search is case-sensitive and multiple terms can be used.

To search, enter text in the search field.
Common searches include: IED name, control block name, the `desc` field on an `LDevice`, `LNode`, Data Object or `ExtRef`.

You can also:

* search on a common data class, e.g. `ACT` or `SPS`
* search on a basic type, e.g. `Quality` or `Dbpos`
* search across spaces, e.g. `"XCBR 4"` or `'XCBR 4'`
* search with wildcards, e.g. `VB01?` or `Bay*Close`

NOTE: We are interested in  what additional search capability users would like, please {url-issues}[log an issue] or {url-chat}[visit the chat].
