The Subscriber Later Binding plugin is for mapping IEC 61850 GOOSE and SV data attributes between publishers and subscribers.

It has the following features:

* Supports GOOSE and SMV
* Provides fast search with a range of filtering and sort options
* Allows subscriptions from either a publisher or subscriber view
* Will instantiate supervisions
* Will show basic type and common data class on hover
* Supports preferred/pre-configured types to IEC 61850-6 Ed 2.1
* Provides copy-to-clipboard in Markdown format

== Overview

The plugin consists of two views with two columns:

|===
a|.Subscriber View
image::subscriber_view.png[xref=image$subscriber_view.png]

a|.Publisher View
image::publisher_view.png[xref=image$publisher_view.png]

|===

At the top of each column there are a number of filter, sorting  or setting options image:sort_filter_settings.png[width=100].
These are explained in more detail in xref:publisher_view.adoc[] and xref:subscriber_view.adoc[].

The choice of which view to use depend on user preferences and the task undertaken.
The publisher view allows the user to conceptualise the task based on the information sent from a particular device (and able to be configured from one device to multiple devices) whereas the subscriber view focuses on the received devices.

== Limitations

The plugin is not targeted for IEC 61850 Ed 1 devices and does not currently support mapping of data objects (only data attributes are supported).
