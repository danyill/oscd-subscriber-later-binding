The Subscriber Later Binding plugin is for mapping IEC 61850 GOOSE and SV data attributes between publishers and subscribers.

It has the following features:

* Supports GOOSE and SMV
* Provides fast search with a range of filtering and sort options
* Allows subscriptions from either a publisher or subscriber view
* Will instantiate supervisions
* Will show basic type and common data class on hover
* Supports preferred/pre-configured types to IEC 61850-6 Ed 2.1
* Provides copy-to-clipboard in Markdown format

== Limitations

The plugin is not targeted for IEC 61850 Ed 1 devices and does not currently support mapping of data objects (only data attributes are supported).
