Published data can be filtered by one or more of:

* Subscribed
* Not Subscribed
* Data Objects
* Quality

It can be convenient to filter by "Not Subscribed" while carrying out mappings as items will be removed from the list once they are subscribed.

If using add-on plugins to provide manufacturer-specific functionality, it can be convenient to filter out quality where it will automatically be mapped for the user (see xref:introduction.adoc#addOnPlugins[add on plugins]).

TIP: It is recommended only to filter out quality and rely on an additional plugin as part of an engineering process where it is known that quality will be mapped correctly.
