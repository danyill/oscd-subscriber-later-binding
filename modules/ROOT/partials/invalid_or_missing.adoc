Files may have missing or invalid subscriptions for a number of reasons.

* A missing subscription may be shown if the SCL file is only a partial representation of the substation configuration (e.g. an icd or cid file)

* Some manufacturer's use the ExtRef information for indicating internal information to the IED (e.g. SEL's proprietary message quality mapping)

If a subscription is missing in the open file, a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark is shown.
If a subscription is invalid an exclamation mark will be shown inside a red circle.
